          <p>
            We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the Web page.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
